# Scammers revenge
Revenging scammers and phishing actors by wasting their time and resources. This is a collection of solutions to cram their inboxes, waste their time, and make their lives miserable.

## Motivation, or: why do I do this?
I received a scam message via SMS. I was bored and decided to waste someone else's time instead of mine.

## Design
I am trying to create some structure here. Each project (=scam revenge) will have its own folder. Inside the project folder, there will be a README.md file with the following structure:
- Project name
- Language used
- Basic action (what are we doing to the scammer)
- How to use (how to run the project)
- Scam reference (some background about the scam & quotes/screenshot/links)

### Contributing
If you have received a scam message and want to waste the scammer's time and make their life miserable - first of all, good for you!  
Secondly, you can contribute to this repository by adding your own project. Just follow the structure above and make a pull request.
